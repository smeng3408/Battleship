# Battleship
You will be prompted to select a game mode: input "classic" to play on a 7x7 board with the traditional ships, or input "mini mode" to play on a 5x5 board with ships of only length 1 or 2. Then, follow the instructions to first place your ships, and then begin the game! At the end, you will be given the choice to view your statistics. 

Happy battling!
